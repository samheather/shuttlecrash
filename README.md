This project is solving the Reach For the Stars challenge, which was given at the 2013 NASA Space Apps Challenge.

Shuttlecrash is a browser-based game in which you are supposed to "crash" a NASA space shuttle on a target by configuring the spaceship to your design before launching it from the ISS. Don't overshoot, or you'll miss the Kennedy runway (and at some point that will probably lead to an explosion of some kind!).

The idea is to introduce kids to the concept of air drag, acceleration, stability and acceleration due to gravity. We are hoping that they will have fun experimenting with how the various parameters of the spaceship affect it's landing performance.
